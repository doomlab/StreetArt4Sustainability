The background features a pale blue sky. The ground on which the buildings rest appears barren and desolate. Dominant colors: beige, light brown, and light blue. (Based on the artist comments, it depicts men in cardboard kraft houses against a soft blue sky, inspired by the 2013 migrant influx to France.

The artist uses this visual narrative to address this societal issue.)","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/461579_3f0c69dc8d814b51b6d17e217a74eb51~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1315,h_689,al_c,q_85,enc_auto/461579_3f0c69dc8d814b51b6d17e217a74eb51~mv2.jpg
